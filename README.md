# hyperbolic-renderer
Software I made for rendering hyperbolic tetrahedra to construct diagrams for my Masters project.
Currently this is only functional inside the Unity editor, and there is no documentation for how to use it yet (apologies).
Once my Uni course is over, I will update this to be useable :)

# hyperbolic-renderer
Software I made for rendering hyperbolic tetrahedra to construct diagrams for my Masters project.
Currently this is only functional inside the Unity editor, and there is no documentation for how to use it yet (apologies). The project is messy, and has some scripts etc. that formed my first attempt at getting this working that are no longer in use.
Once my Uni course is over, I will update this to be useable :)
